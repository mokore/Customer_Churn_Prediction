# ConnectTel Customer_Churn_Prediction
Data Analysis and Customer Churn Prediction carried out for a telecommunications company ConnectTel

## Overview
This is a machine learning project for a company in the telecommunications industry, ConnectTel. ConnectTel is a leading telecommunications company at the forefront of innovation and connectivity solutions, with a strong presence in the global market.

## Problem Statement
ConnectTel is faced with customer churn challenges which is a threat to its business sustainbility and growth. Current strategies to retain customer are not working as expected. They wish to overcome this challenge by implementing state of the art churn prediction system leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Project Objective
The project objectives include unearthing insights from the data provided and develop the most effective machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. the aim is to enhance customer loyalty and maintain a competetive edge in the industry.

## Data Sources
ConnectTel customer data required to carry out analytics and predictions was provided by 10Alytics. It consists of 7043 rows and 21 columns. The dataset contains minimal customer features and the telecommunications services they have subscribed to. It also contains specific information on the customersâ€™ loyalty status which confirms if they have churned or not.

# Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase involved an indept review of the data to observe its characteristics and confirm if it is in the appropriate form for machine learning application. Missing values were identified and updated, incorrect attribute type specification was also discovered and fixed. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualizations were applied which helped to reveal many important insights related to the dataset and uncover the correlations within amongst the attributes.

## Machine Learning Model
Given that the dataset has a label, the customer churn prediction project was treated as a classification problem. Hence, several classisfication algorithms were utilised to build models out of which the best performing model was to be selected as most suitable for the prediction task. Some of the classification algorithms used in the model building phase include:

- **Extreme Gradient Boost**              -  **SGD**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- **Support Vector Machine**

## Evaluation Metrics
to assess the performance of the machine learning models, the following evaluation metrics were used:

- **Accuracy:**
- **Precision:**
- **Recall:**
- **F1 Score:**
- **AUC-ROC:**
